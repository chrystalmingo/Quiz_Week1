My personal favorite is Video Studio Code, it is a source code editor developed by Microsoft. The reason I love it is because it is user-friendly, and can be used to edit, run, and debug source code for applications. Video Studio Code is impressive because it is cross-platform and works effectively on Windows, Linux, and macOS, meaning no matter what operating system I use, I can use an editor that I am used to and comfortable with. And my favorite part is that Visual Studio Code, has this capability called IntelliSense for programming languages, therefore depending on the programming language you are working with, it helps auto-fill syntactical information.
